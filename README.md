# Road Surface and Boundary Detection Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting road surfaces and boundaries using advanced computer vision techniques. The goal is to enhance navigational systems and improve safety on roadways by accurately identifying different road conditions.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EmoDepressedKidEater/road-surface-recognition.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   
   ```bash
   cd road-surface-recognition
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To use the road surface and boundary detection features, run the following command:

```bash
python main.py --input <path_to_input> --output <path_to_output>
```

Replace `<path_to_input>` with the path to the image or video file you wish to analyze, and `<path_to_output>` with the desired path for saving the results.

## Dataset Information
The dataset used for training and testing the model includes diverse samples of road surfaces under various conditions. The dataset can be accessed at [Dataset Link](https://example.com/dataset).

For detailed descriptions and additional information on each data sample, please refer to the dataset documentation.
